# Hi, I'm Davis Wolfermann (OffRange)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Davis born on July 23, 2005, a passionate individual who enjoys creating secure solutions and exploring the fascinating field of artificial intelligence. I recently graduated from high school and am now pursuing a degree in Cyber Security at the "Hochschule Mittweida - University of Applied Sciences", where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills.

## Projects

### Password Manager

One of my notable projects is the Password Manager a secure and user-friendly solution designed for managing passwords efficiently. With this tool, you can conveniently store, generate, and retrieve passwords. The project is open source, and you can find the code and documentation in the [Password Manager repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PasswordManager). I welcome contributions and encourage you to make use of it for your personal needs.

### Password Strength AI

Another exciting project I've developed is the Password Strength AI. This AI model utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate the strength of a given password accurately. By analyzing various factors, it provides a reliable prediction of password strength. If you're interested in exploring the code or using the model, check out the [Password Strength AI repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PassStrengthAI).

### Power Control System

The Power Control System is a project that allows users to remotely manage their devices by shutting down, logging out, rebooting, and booting (using Wake-On-LAN) through an Android device. The system is composed of two main components:
- **Power Control Server:** This server must be installed on the device you wish to control, whether it be macOS, Linux, or Windows. You can find the server code in the [Power Control Server repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PowerControlServer).
- **Power Control:** This is the Android application that interacts with the server, available exclusively for Android devices. You can explore the app code in the [Power Control repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PowerControl).

### PassGen Library

PassGen is a Kotlin library designed for easy generation of passwords using a Kotlin DSL (Domain-Specific Language). It offers a flexible and powerful way to create secure passwords programmatically. If you're interested in using or contributing to this library, visit the [PassGen repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PassGen).
