# Hi, I'm Davis Wolfermann (OffRange)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Davis born on July 23, 2005, a passionate individual who enjoys creating secure solutions and exploring the fascinating field of artificial intelligence. Currently, I'm about to graduate from high school, striving to expand my knowledge and skills.

## Projects

### Password Manager

One of my notable projects is the Password Manager a secure and user-friendly solution designed for managing passwords efficiently. With this tool, you can conveniently store, generate, and retrieve passwords. The project is open source, and you can find the code and documentation in the [Password Manager repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PasswordManager). I welcome contributions and encourage you to make use of it for your personal needs.

### Password Strength AI

Another exciting project I've developed is the Password Strength AI. This AI model utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate the strength of a given password accurately. By analyzing various factors, it provides a reliable prediction of password strength. If you're interested in exploring the code or using the model, check out the [Password Strength AI repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PassStrengthAI).
