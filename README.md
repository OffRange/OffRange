# Hi, I'm Davis (OffRange)!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about creating secure solutions and exploring the field of artificial intelligence. Here, you'll find some of my notable projects.

## Projects

### Password Manager

My password manager is a secure and user-friendly solution for managing your passwords. It provides a convenient way to store, generate, and retrieve passwords. The project is open source, and you can find the code and documentation in the [Password Manager repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PasswordManager). Feel free to contribute or use it for your personal needs.

### Password Strength AI

The Password Strength AI is an AI model I developed that estimates the strength of a given password. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various factors and provide a reliable strength prediction. If you're interested in exploring the code or using the model, check out the [Password Strength AI repository](https://github.com/OffRange/PassStrengthAI).
